    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>What we say matters. Words are singularly the most powerful force available to humanity.<br> We can choose to use this power constructively, building up others, or destructively tearing them down. It only takes a few words to hurt someone. <br>And those wounds may heal but they leave scars that never disappear. Our words have enormous power with the ability to help or to harm, to heal or to hurt, to lift or to destroy, to build up or to tear down, to offend or to befriend, <br>to affirm or to alienate, to comfort or to criticize.</p>
